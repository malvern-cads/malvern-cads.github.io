From the knowledge that we got [last week](/2019/09/30/recruitment-process/), we wanted to go through all of the applications we had received in order to 'sieve' them down to a number of candidates to interview. It would be too time consuming to interview everybody so based off applications, we needed to only interview the top candidates.

Everyone started off with an application form to score and then rotated them around until everyone had scored all of them. The scores were then taken in and averaged in order to rank the candidates. We then chose to interview the top candidates.

We plan to conduct the interviews later this month, we are going to get in contact with all of the candidates either to tell them why they didn't pass this stage, or with information about their interview.
