It's been almost a month since the last CADS meeting. We've had a mix of school holidays, exam leave and exams. The Year 13s have also left CADS due to their A Levels and this year we only have 5 more sessions.

To get back into the swing of things, we decided to brainstorm ideas that we would like to learn next year. Here is a list of some of the things that we thought that we'd like to do in the next year (some of which we have decided on).

* Trip to a local cyber security company
* Learning Linux basics
* Pen testing
* CVI (cyber investigations on companies/teams)
* Presentation Skills
* Hashing and Encryption
* Raspberry Pi
* Personal Statement Writing
* CV Building
* Interview Skills
* Updating CADS (branding, website, advertising)
* More trips (GCHQ, National Crime Agency)
* History of Cyber Security
* More cool talks
* Networking (mapping, management, structure, ports and functions, pinholes)
* Traffic snooping and spoofing
* Internet and computer law
* How malware spreads today (modern threats with malware, e.g. power plants)
* Cyber Warfare
* Celebrities and Stalking (cyber risks and common sense online)
* Touch typing
* Encryption and Tor
* Building Networks
* More trips
* Local careers fair

Apart from the list, we had a discussion about the new students who would be joining next year and some other internal stuff.
