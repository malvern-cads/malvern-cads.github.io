This week in CADS we were researching about topics that we could present about in an assembly in our school to raise awareness.

We started by watching some videos about the benefits of ditching social media and simply spending less time on your phone. We learnt that doing either of these boosts productivity, well-being and attention span.

We also had a think about how we could create an assembly to raise cyber security that would be both engaging and educational for students.

We also focused a little on the CADS branding by finishing up the logo and thinking of some possible marketing opportunities.

That's all for this week, check back next week another article like this.
