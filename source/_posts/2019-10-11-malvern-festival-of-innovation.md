This year, a local festival near us called the ['Malvern Festival of Innovation'](https://www.festival-innovation.com/) were hosting a Cyber Security Day and this was opportunity was turned into a mini-trip. Only 8 of us attended in the end as it took up the whole school day.

The day kicked off at 9:30am, giving us a little bit of extra sleep in the morning compared to a normal school day 😄 and finished just before 4pm. The day contained 11 talks in total. If you're interested in what the talks were about, feel free to checkout the [2019 Cyber Day schedule](http://web.archive.org/web/20191011161150/https://www.festival-innovation.com/programme/cyber-security).

Although a lot of the talks were aimed at companies (meaning that they weren't super relevant to us), they were still quite interesting and we learnt a few things. A lot of the attendees were business people from companies ranging from Intel to smaller companies offering pentesting services. We didn't end up networking very much, but we did have a little chat to all of the stalls and tried to find people that would be willing to speak at one of our CADS meetings.

*On an unrelated note, we are conducting the interviews for the new members of CADS next week which means that there is no meeting, so there won't be a post until next Monday.*
