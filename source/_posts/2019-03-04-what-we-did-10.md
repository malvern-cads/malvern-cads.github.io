We are finally into double digits with the 10th weekly update post!

This week we started preparing some of the things that we were going to take to the [Worcestershire Skills Show](https://www.worcestershire.gov.uk/careersportal/homepage/22/worcestershire_skills_show).

We'll be showing off some tools and techniques used in the real world such as [Hydra](https://sectools.org/tool/hydra/), [a USB Rubber Ducky](https://shop.hak5.org/products/usb-rubber-ducky-deluxe) and more.

With Hydra, we are going to show people how easy it is to crack simple passwords on websites and perhaps show how a stronger one takes a lot more time to guess.

With the USB Rubber Ducky, we are going to demonstrate the kind of attacks you can perform just with physical access to a computer (even if you have a couple of seconds).

We hope to talk with you there!
