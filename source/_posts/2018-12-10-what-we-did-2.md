This week about half the group listened to a presentation on secure coding. We learnt some of the top problems with web applications such as SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting and more.

The other half of the group organised the assembly that we are doing to almost all of the years at The Chase.

In the second half of the meetup this week we started to design some posters to put around schools to raise awareness about safety online and general cyber safety.

The next few weeks we are having a break for Christmas so we'll get another update next year. Have a great Christmas and a Happy New Year!
