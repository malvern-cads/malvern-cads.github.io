Today was our first CADS meeting of 2019!

This week we finished up our assembly and prepared the PowerPoint.

The presentation is going to include cyber security facts, tips on how to secure yourself, recommendations on how to manage screen time and a special surprise (that the government doesn't want you to know about).

The assemblies are commencing in a fortnights time and next week we the presentation is getting checked over by The Chase's own Sixth Form Pastoral Leader: Mrs Massam!
