## What is CADS?

CADS is a youth initiative setup by [Meta MD](https://meta.aero/mmd/), with the aim to encourage students from schools in the Malvern area to get involved with and gain experience in the Cyber Security industry. It is great fun for all, and you don't need to know anything about computers to join!

## Who are we?

We are currently a group of year 13s (plus our hosts Cameron & John from Meta MD) who gather every week after school on a monday, from 3:30 to 4:30, to see presentations and talks done by a multitude of people (although unfortunately the pandemic has affected the amount of external visitors we can have in to do talks).

We provide a great social space with lots of unique personalities, and every session is always a laugh!

If you want to get a better understanding of what our talks are about, check out our [blog](https://cadscheme.co.uk/archives/)!
