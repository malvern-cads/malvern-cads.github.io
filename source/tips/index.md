The Internet is an amazing place. You can instantly share pictures of your cat, play games with friends from the other side of the world and get access to almost a billion hours of videos on YouTube. With all this at the click of a couple of buttons, it's sometimes easy to forget about keeping safe.

To help you out we've compiled a short list of Online Safety tips to keep you safe when using computers.

* **DON'T SCAN QR CODES - by scanning QR codes that you don't trust, you could be directed to a malicious website.**
* Use a **different password** for each account (or use a password manager).
* Only accept **follow requests** on social media from people you know directly (not just to get lots of followers).
* Check that you are visiting a website with **https** (or a green padlock), this is more secure for typing sensitive information such as passwords.
* Use **cloud storage** (e.g Google Drive, Dropbox, etc...) instead of USB drives.
* Keep your account details private and control your **privacy settings**.
* Always remember to **log off** when finished (especially on computers and other devices that other people are using)
* Don't share **sensitive information** online. Make sure your address, school, phone number, etc... are not shown on your account.
* If you receive any suspicious or distressing content online, block the account, **report** it and talk to an adult (parents or a teacher at school).
* Make sure your antivirus/anti-malware software is **up to date**.
